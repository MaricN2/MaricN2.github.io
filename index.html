    <div id="about">
        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>I'm a young student from Serbia who is currently studying front-end web development. I think this is an interesting career, and so far I have been enjoying my journey of learning. Graphic design and theories behind it have always been interesting to me, and being able to create something concrete is a very satisfying benefit of this job. With the help of my friends i will hopefully be able to master the rest of this field.</p>

        <h1 id="right">My current goals:</h1>
        <p id="right">My current goals are to master all the common tools of front-end development. I'm currently finishing basic CSS and HTML, and soon i will start with JavaScript and inform myself about back-end programming. After that I need to work on bootstrap and other frameworks, so I still have a long road ahead.</p>

        <h1>My design:</h1>
        <p>Photoshop is an immportant tool for designing a website, and while I taught I was decent at it I realised I have a lot more to learn. The rules and theories about what is and isn't appealing is also invaluable for creating an appealing look for the site, whichc is why I want to study it further. Hopefully I can master these skills along side my programming skills.</p>
